### Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This repository contains almost all assignments I finished when I taught myself CS61A. 

In this class, you will learn three languages: Python, Scheme and SQL and many important concepts and skills in your programming
such as higher-order function, recursion, class, data abstraction, etc.
