# CS61A-sp18

This repository contains four projects I finished when I taught myself CS61A.

* [The Game of Hog](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/proj/hog/): helps us familiarize usage of control statements and higher-order functions by developing a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog.
* [Yelp Maps](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/proj/maps/): helps us familiarize the concept of data abstraction and some basic python skills such as sequences and mutable data.
* [Ants Vs. SomeBees](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/proj/ants/): is my favorite project. This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program. If you are struggling understanding object, method, class, etc, it would definitely be a great exercise.
* [Scheme Interpreter](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/proj/scheme/): lets us develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language and implement some small programs in Scheme. It would be a very challengeable project.
